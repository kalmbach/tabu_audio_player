Tabu Audio Player
=================

Tabu is a simple GTK+ audio player with client-side decorations drawn
using Cairo.

In simple words, it doesn't make use standard GTK+ widgets, instead
using it's own. Tabu is designed to be simple, yet elegant. It's still
in it's early stages of development and supports only basic music playing functionality.

Feature highlights:
- Tabu uses GStreamer as it's backend
- Fast and light-weight
